### Overview
- **Goal**: Understand and apply a writing style that meets readers' expectations in technical contexts.
- **Key Characteristics**: Effective technical writing is **concise, precise, direct, and well organized**.
- **Focus**: Prioritizes the efficient and unambiguous transfer of information over descriptive or lengthy prose.

## 3.1 Voice and Tone
- **Definition**: Style encompasses the **voice, tone, and mood** of writing, affecting how the audience understands and responds.
- **Audience & Purpose**: Style must be adapted to the situation, genre, and reader's expectations.
- **Key Concepts**:
    - **Active vs. Passive Voice**: Prefer active voice for clarity and directness (e.g., "The team designed the circuit" vs. "The circuit was designed by the team").
    - **Nominalization**: Avoid turning verbs into nouns, as it creates wordy, indirect prose (e.g., "make an adjustment" -> "adjust").
    - **Personal vs. Impersonal Tone**: Use personal pronouns (e.g., "we," "I") appropriately to build rapport, but maintain professionalism. The choice depends on context and audience.

## 3.2 Mechanics and Grammar
- **Objective**: Recognize and address common writing errors and habits.
- **Focus**: Review grammatical issues common in engineering writing (FE and FEH contexts).

## 3.3 Citations and Citation Styles
- **Purpose**: Citing sources gives credit, provides evidence, and avoids plagiarism.
- **Common Styles**: IEEE and APA are reviewed for their basic components and application in technical documents.

## Principles of Technical Style

### 1. Concise
- **Goal**: Eliminate "filler" or "fluff" to make sentences clear and simple.
- **Strategies**:
    - Avoid vague language (e.g., "stuff," "things," "kind of").
    - Eliminate redundancies (e.g., "end result" -> "result").
    - Replace wordy phrases with direct ones (e.g., "due to the fact that" -> "because").
- **Note**: Concision is a priority but can be sacrificed for tone (e.g., delivering bad news kindly).

### 2. Precise
- **Goal**: Avoid ambiguity; ensure information is specific, verifiable, and meaningful.
- **Strategies**:
    - **Quantify**: Use exact numbers and measurements instead of vague terms (e.g., "three holes" not "several holes").
    - **Use Objective Observations**: State facts and criteria (e.g., "reached 23°C" not "was cool").
    - **Represent Certainty Accurately**: Avoid absolute terms like "prove"; use "suggest," "indicate," or "reduce."
- **Application in Lab Docs**:
    - Address **systematic error** (e.g., inaccurate tools/assumptions) and **random error** (unpredictable factors minimized by repeated trials).

### 3. Direct
- **Goal**: Get to the point quickly; use clear, appropriate vocabulary.
- **Strategies**:
    - Avoid "flowery" or pretentious language (e.g., "utilize" -> "use").
    - State the purpose and scope early (e.g., in email subject lines or report introductions).
    - Use jargon only when it improves communication for the audience.
- **Plain Language Example**: U.S. government guidelines emphasize clear, reader-focused communication that is easy to find, understand, and use.

### 4. Well Organized
- **Goal**: Present information in a logical, intentional, and consistent structure.
- **Strategies**:
    - **Outline** during the planning stage.
    - Use **advance organizers** to forecast content.
    - Employ **headings, subheadings, and transition words** to guide the reader.
    - Use the **BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)** method in paragraphs: start with a direct topic sentence.
- **Common Organizational Models**:
    | Model | Use Case |
    |---|---|
    | Chronological | Progress reports, project plans |
    | Spatial | User manuals, product descriptions |
    | Priority | Safety docs, proposals |
    | General to Specific | White papers, presentations |
    | Problem → Method → Solution | Lab reports, technical reports |
- **Lab Report Note**: Keep **Results** (data presentation) and **Discussion** (data interpretation) in separate sections; avoid mixing them.
