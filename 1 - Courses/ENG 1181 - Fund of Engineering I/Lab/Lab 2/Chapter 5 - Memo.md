## Lab Report Structure & Content Guide

**Header:** Includes submitted to, created by, team members, course, university, date.
**Length:** No strict limit, but longer than a memo.

1.  **Executive Summary**
    *   **Purpose:** A one-page standalone overview for busy readers.
    *   **Content:** Summarizes the entire report (objective, key results, conclusions).
    *   **Rule:** **Write it last.** No new information, no figures/tables from the report.

2.  **Table of Contents**
    *   Lists all major sections and appendices with page numbers.

3.  **Introduction**
    *   **State the objective** of the lab in your own words.
    *   Provide a brief **"roadmap"** of the report's contents.

4.  **Experimental Methodology**
    *   Describe the **procedure and equipment** in paragraph form so it can be replicated.
    *   Use images to support the text when appropriate.

5.  **Results**
    *   **Present all relevant observations and data.**
    *   **Order:** Present results in the order the experiments were conducted.
    *   **Use a mix of text, figures, tables, and equations.**
    *   **Rule:** This is the **only** section to introduce new results.
    *   **Tip:** Move large raw data tables to an **appendix** to improve readability.

6.  **Discussion**
    *   **Analyze** the results.
    *   **Identify trends** relevant to the lab's objectives.
    *   **Compare results to theory/expectations.** Do they "make sense"?
    *   **Address errors and limitations** (both systematic and random). Discuss what *could* have gone wrong, even if you're unsure it did.

7.  **Conclusions & Recommendations**
    *   **Summarize** the experiment and highlight key findings from the discussion.
    *   **State clear conclusions** tied to the objective.
    *   **Provide recommendations** for the scenario posed in the lab.
    *   **Suggest solutions** to fix the errors mentioned in the discussion.

8.  **References**
    *   List all cited sources (lab documents, textbooks, articles).

9.  **Appendices**
    *   **Purpose:** For supplemental material (raw data, calculations, diagrams).
    *   **Format:** `Appendix A: Descriptive Title` (e.g., Appendix B: Experimental Data).
    *   **Rules:**
        *   Each appendix must be referenced in the main text.
        *   Each starts on a new page.
        *   Label figures/tables within as `A.1`, `B.3`, etc.
        *   **Do not** duplicate items between the main text and appendices.

## Lab Memo Structure & Content Guide

**Header:** Uses standard memo format (Date, To, From, Subject).
**Length:** Shorter than a full report.

*   **Introduction:** Same as Lab Report. State the objective and provide a roadmap.
*   **Results and Discussion (Combined Section)**
    *   This section merges the **Results** and **Discussion** from a Lab Report.
    *   **First,** concisely present the significant results and observations.
    *   **Then,** immediately analyze them (discuss trends, compare to theory, address error).
*   **Conclusions & Recommendations:** Identical to the Lab Report section.
*   **References & Appendices:** Same rules and purpose as the Lab Report.

## Testing Log

*   **Purpose:** A chronological record of all testing performed.
*   **Format:** No specific format required, but **consistency is key**.
*   **Must Include:**
    *   **When:** Date, time, and duration of the test.
    *   **Who:** Who conducted and who observed.
    *   **Where:** Location of the test.
    *   **What:** Specific methodology used.
    *   **Why:** Purpose of the test.
    *   **Result:** What happened.

## Key Takeaways
*   The main difference between a **Report** and a **Memo** is the assumed knowledge of the audience.
*   **Results** are for presenting data; **Discussion** is for analyzing it. They are combined in a Memo.
*   **Appendices** are for supporting material, not a dumping ground for messy data.
*   **Always write the Executive Summary last.**
*   A **Testing Log** is a crucial record of all testing activity and must be maintained meticulously.
