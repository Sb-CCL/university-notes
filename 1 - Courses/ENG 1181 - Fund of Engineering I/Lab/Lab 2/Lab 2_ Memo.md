From: Group 4 \- Team Cougar (Shuabe Bashir, Hlichal Khrihvel, Ibrahim Sesay)  
Subject: Lab 2 Format

# Introduction

The purpose of this lab was to understand technical writing strategies by examining the Space shuttle Challenger disaster as caste study. Understanding where there were communication issues and how we can use the strategies identified in the Fundamentals of Technical Communication guidebook (Tech Comm Guide) to develop a more refined memo. 

# Results & Discussion

Our group contains 3 students that are assigned to identify strategies and protocols by collaboratively working together over the course of the lab. Each member has an assigned section that they will research the protocols and strategies using the Fundamentals of Technical Communication guidebook (Tech Comm Guide).

# Part 1

**“Concise” & “Precise” (subsections of Ch. 3\) \- Shuabe Bashir**

The person who is describing  “Concise” & “Precise” is Shuabe Bashir, and I have found four important takeaways from this section. These points are:

* Always make sure that your sentences are clear, simple, and easy to understand.  
* Respect the reader's time by not adding fluff, filler, or unrelated content into your communications.   
* Avoid vague words or sentences that might cause the reader to second guess, but by using facts, measurements, and details.   
* Be as clear as possible so that the reader can best understand what you are saying, and so that they can easily act upon it without confusion.  
  


**“Direct” & “Well Organized” (subsections of Ch. 3\) \- Shuabe Bashir**

The person who is describing  “Direct” & “Well Organized” is Shuabe Bashir, and I have found four important takeaways from this section. These points are:

* Make sure to get to the point by using the BLUF method which is Bottom Line Up Front, that states that the most important information is listed first before the details.   
* Be clear with your words by using simple words, always making sure that you are easily understood by those who are not experts.  
* Be more organized by presenting your data and findings in a logical manner by presenting the problem first, methods used to fix the problem, and the solution to the problem.   
* Make it easy to navigate your communication by organizing it using headings and subheadings, allowing the reader to easily follow your document in a familiar manner.

**Voice & Tone \- Ibrahim Sesay**

The person who is describing Voice & Tone is Ibrahim Sesay, and the four important takeaways from this section are:

* 

**Mechanics and Grammar \- Hlichal Khrihvel**

The person who is describing Mechanics and Grammar is Hlichal Khrihvel, and the four important takeaways from this section are:

* 

## Part 2 \- Scenario 1

The problem we need to solve is to convince the direct supervisor that there is a critical failure with the O-ring we manufacture. This is an internal email within the company, so the direct audience is the supervisor who is more aware of our processes, and therefore needs the communication to be direct, to the point, and well organized so that they can quickly take action after hearing our concern.

| To: R. K. Lund \<R. K. Lund@MTI.org\>  From: Team Four \<Team.Four@MTI.org\>  Subject: URGENT: Critical Issue \- Team Required to Fix O-Ring Failure Risk Dear Mr. Lund, We need to take immediate action and form a dedicated team to fix this critical O-Ring failure before there is a catastrophic loss of life during launch. New data has been obtained from our latest SRM 16A nozzle joint examination.  The SRM 16A nozzle is experiencing joint erosion in the primary O-ring, causing the secondary O-Ring from sealing. This is a design failure which is causing the secondary O-ring to not respond to the clevis opening, preventing pressurization.  If this issue is not resolved and a team formed to find a solution, we will not only cause flight to fail, damage the launch pads, but most importantly cause a major loss of life of the crew. I will reach back again with a formal request tomorrow so that we can establish a dedicated team and provide a solution this week. Sincerely,  Team Four |

This email directly addresses the problem from the beginning without hiding it later in the message. It addresses the main issue of the original memo by being clear and to the point but detailed for the supervisor to be aware of the issue due to their internal company knowledge. It also initiates the start of a meeting and forming a team by following up. It provides information of the latest tests with the O-ring and offers to schedule a forming a team.

## Part 2 \- Scenario 2

For this section, the direct audience is NASA, who we are contracted with and are our client. We need to convey that there is an issue, but the manner in which we communicate must be different. 

The tone that is used for this communication should be more formal and professional, not frightening. We can continue to have them be our client, so we should make sure that we update them of the issue and that we are working on a solution. We should make this communication more about the solution, rather than our failure or design issues with the O-ring. 

The goal of this communication is to build confidence in our work, our company, and our commitment to resolving this problem. All internal dealings within the team should be private, instead we should be representing the company in a positive tone, offering to update them on our progress. 

## Conclusions & Recommendations

In conclusion, this lab shows us the importance of developing an effective technical communication skill. In order to successfully communicate with internal teams and customers, we need to develop a precise, concise, direct, and well structured framework with the correct tone. All effective communications should be easy to understand with a set goal and purpose. That communication is key and decisions are dependent on getting your message across multiple audiences. That it's important to tailor your message depending who you’re talking to with the mission to offer clarity both with external and internal memos.
