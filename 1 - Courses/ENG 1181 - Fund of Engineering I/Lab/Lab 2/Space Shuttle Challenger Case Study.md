### Key Communication Failures:
1.  **Quantitative Evidence:**
    *   A **9-year timeline (1977-1986)** of internal documentation exists.
    *   Documents repeatedly pinpointed the technical cause (O-ring failure in clevis joint) and strongly recommended halting flights until it was fixed.
    *   **Key Memo:** [R.M. Boisjoly's 1985 Memo](https://jodoran.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/boisjoly-memo_1985.pdf)

2.  **Qualitative Issues:**
    *   **Audience Failure:** Dangers were not communicated effectively to the right audience (NASA management).
    *   **Inter-Organizational Conflict:** A critical lack of direct communication between vendor (Morton-Thiokol - MTI) and customer (NASA). Most documentation was internal; they "didn't talk to one another enough."
    *   **Inherent Conflicts:** The disaster highlights the classic conflicts between:
        *   Engineering vs. Management
        *   Safety vs. Schedule & Cost
        *   Vendor vs. Customer relationships

**Interview Resource:** [NPR Interview with MTI Engineer Bob Ebeling](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/01/28/464744781/30-years-after-disaster-challenger-engineer-still-blames-himself)

## Lab Procedure: Part 1 - Tech Comm Writing Style Jigsaw

**Goal:** Become familiar with the Tech Comm Guide by having each member become an expert on one writing strategy.

1.  **Assign Topics:** Each team member takes one of the following:
    *   “Concise” & “Precise” (Ch. 3)
    *   “Direct” & “Well Organized” (Ch. 3)
    *   Voice & Tone
    *   Mechanics and Grammar

2.  **Answer for Your Assigned Topic:**
    *   Summarize four key ideas in your own words.
    *   Explain how using this strategy affects the reader and why it's desirable in technical communication.

## Lab Procedure: Part 2 - The Challenger Memo Problem

**Goal:** Apply technical writing principles and recognize the importance of **audience**.

**Scenario 1: Email to MTI Direct Supervisor**
*   **Task:** Rewrite the Boisjoly memo's information as a more effective email to a direct supervisor at MTI.
*   **Process:** Complete all steps of the **DR PIE Process**:
    *   **Define:** State the purpose, your relationship to the audience, what you expect them to do, and what they need from the email.
    *   **Represent & Plan:** Create an outline for the email.
    *   **Implement:** Write the full, polished email. Follow email guidelines (Tech Comm Guide Ch. 6). Use names from the original memo for the greeting and your team names in the signature.
    *   **Evaluate:** Provide a short evaluation explaining why your email achieves its purpose.

**Scenario 2: Email to NASA Client**
*   **Task:** Only complete the **Define** step of DR PIE for this new audience.
*   **Focus:** Use a bulleted list to emphasize the **differences** in audience needs (Internal Supervisor vs. External Client) and what changes you would make to the email because of them. *Do not write the full email.*
