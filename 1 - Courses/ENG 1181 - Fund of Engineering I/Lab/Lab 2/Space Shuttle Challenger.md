NASA ignored the engineers who said to wait for the weather to change, as the O-Rings did not seal correctly due to the temperature. 

The Engineer said he didn't argue enough with the data, that said that it would explode. 

Fuel escaped due to a compromised seal. The supporting struts connecting the rockets tot he fuel tanks will fail. The booster will slam into the tank, and rocket fuel will ignite causing an explosion. 

The Shutte
- Its been reliable, but after every launch, repairs need to be made 
- Engineers warned that the stress of launching my lead to a failure

Florida had a cold day that day that affected the seal on the o-rings. The launch pad was covered in ice that day. Cold temperatures. 

Engineers have warned that the space shuttle is being overused - only matter of time before there is an issue. The supervisors ignore the engineers.
