## Purpose
---
The purpose of this lab is to apply the principles of [[1.7 Ohm's Law]] and [[1.17 Series and parallel combinations]] to two scenarios by finding the **internal resistance** of a battery and analyzing the **power loss** in electrical transmission cables. You will be calculating voltage, resistance, current, and power.
