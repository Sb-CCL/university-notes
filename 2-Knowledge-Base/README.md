# Knowledge Base

This section contains interconnected knowledge that spans across courses and disciplines. The goal is to build a network of understanding that transcends individual classes.

## ðŸ§  Purpose

The Knowledge Base serves as your:
- Second brain for academic concepts
- Cross-disciplinary connection hub
- Long-term knowledge repository
- Research and idea development space

## ðŸ“‚ Organization

### Concepts/
Atomic ideas and fundamental principles that form the building blocks of your knowledge. Each concept should be:
- Self-contained and clearly explained
- Linked to related concepts
- Connected to course materials where applicable

### People/
Important academics, researchers, and professionals in your field. Include:
- Their key contributions
- Relevant publications
- Personal notes from lectures or talks

### Research/
Your original ideas, research questions, and literature notes. Organize by:
- Research projects
- Literature reviews
- Methodologies
- Findings and conclusions

### References/
Permanent notes from authoritative sources:
- Textbook principles
- Foundational theories
- Important formulas and equations
- Key experiments and studies

## ðŸ”„ Integration with Courses

Link knowledge base notes to specific course materials using:
- `[[Wikilinks]]` to connect related concepts
- Tags like `#course/CODE-101` to show relevance
- Backlinks to see all connections

## ðŸŽ“ Best Practices

1. **Atomicity**: Keep notes focused on single concepts
2. **Linking**: Connect each new note to at least 2 existing notes
3. **Review**: Regularly revisit and update knowledge base notes
4. **Synthesis**: Create summary notes that connect multiple concepts

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress Tracking

Use these status markers:
- `#status/seed` - Newly planted idea
- `#status/growing` - In development
- `#status/mature` - Well-developed concept
- `#status/evergreen` - Continuously evolving note
