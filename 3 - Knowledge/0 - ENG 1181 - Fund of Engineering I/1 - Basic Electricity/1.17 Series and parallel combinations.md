# 1.17 Series and Parallel Combinations

## Definition
**Series circuits** have components connected end-to-end in a single path, while **parallel circuits** have components connected across common points, creating multiple paths for current flow.

## Series Circuits

### Characteristics
- **Same current** flows through all components: I� = I� = I� = Itotal
- **Voltages add up** across components: Vtotal = V� + V� + V�
- **Total resistance** is sum of individual resistances: Rtotal = R� + R� + R�

### Series Resistance Formula
```
Rtotal = R� + R� + R� + ... + Rn
```

## Parallel Circuits

### Characteristics
- **Same voltage** across all components: V� = V� = V� = Vtotal
- **Currents add up**: Itotal = I� + I� + I�
- **Total resistance** is less than the smallest individual resistance

### Parallel Resistance Formula
```
1/Rtotal = 1/R� + 1/R� + 1/R� + ... + 1/Rn
```

## Special Cases

### Two Resistors in Parallel
```
Rtotal = (R� � R�)/(R� + R�)
```

## MATLAB Implementation
```matlab
function [R_series, R_parallel] = resistor_combinations(resistors)
% Calculate series and parallel combinations of resistors
R_series = sum(resistors);
R_parallel = 1 / sum(1 ./ resistors);
end
```
