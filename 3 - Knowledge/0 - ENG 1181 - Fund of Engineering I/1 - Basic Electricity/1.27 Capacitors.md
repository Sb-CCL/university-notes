# 1.27 Capacitors

## Definition
A **capacitor** is an electrical component that stores electrical energy in an electric field between two conductive plates separated by an insulating material (dielectric). Capacitors oppose changes in voltage and store energy when charged.

## Key Points
- Store electrical energy in an electric field (not magnetic field like inductors)
- Capacitance measured in Farads (F), typically μF, nF, or pF in practice
- Block DC current in steady state, allow AC current to pass
- Charge and discharge exponentially with time constant τ = RC
- Energy storage capability depends on capacitance and voltage squared

## Formula/Equation
```
Basic Capacitance:
C = Q/V                     (Capacitance = Charge/Voltage)

Energy Stored:
E = ½CV² = ½QV = Q²/(2C)   (Energy in Joules)

Capacitive Reactance (AC):
Xc = 1/(2πfC)              (Reactance in Ohms)

Series Capacitors:
1/Ctotal = 1/C₁ + 1/C₂ + 1/C₃

Parallel Capacitors:
Ctotal = C₁ + C₂ + C₃

RC Time Constant:
τ = RC                      (63% charge/discharge time)
```

## Examples
### Example 1: Energy Storage Calculation
- Given: C = 100μF, V = 12V
- Find: Energy stored in capacitor
- Solution: E = ½CV² = ½(100×10⁻⁶)(12)² = 7.2×10⁻³ J = 7.2 mJ

### Example 2: Series Capacitor Combination
- Given: C₁ = 10μF, C₂ = 15μF in series
- Find: Total capacitance
- Solution: 1/Ctotal = 1/10 + 1/15 = 5/30, Ctotal = 6μF

## Applications
- **Power supply filtering** - Smooth DC voltage by reducing ripple
- **Energy storage** - Camera flash units, defibrillators, hybrid vehicles
- **Timing circuits** - RC oscillators, delay circuits, PWM generation
- **AC coupling** - Block DC while passing AC signals in amplifiers
- **Motor starting** - Provide starting torque for single-phase AC motors

## Common Mistakes
- **Confusing series/parallel rules** - Capacitors combine opposite to resistors
- **Ignoring polarity** - Electrolytic capacitors must be connected correctly
- **Voltage rating violations** - Exceeding voltage rating can destroy capacitor
- **Time constant misunderstanding** - Takes 5τ for ~99% charge/discharge

## Summary
Capacitors are fundamental passive components that store electrical energy in electric fields. Understanding their behavior in DC and AC circuits, energy storage capabilities, and combination rules is essential for circuit analysis and design in electrical engineering applications.
