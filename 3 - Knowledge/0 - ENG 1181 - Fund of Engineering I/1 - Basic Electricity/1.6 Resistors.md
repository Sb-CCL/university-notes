## Resistor
---
A resistor controls electrical flow between its two terminals via **resistance**, measured in **ohms (Ω)**. Higher resistance requires more effort to produce the same current. 

## Resistivity (ρ)
---
Resistivity is measured in units of ohm-meters (Ω·m) and is represented by the Greek letter ρ (rho).

1. The material it's made from (its **Resistivity**).
2. Its physical shape and size.

**Example:** A long, thin copper wire has more resistance than a short, thick copper wire, even though they are both made of the same material (same ρ).

$$
R = \frac{\rho L}{A}
$$
- **R** = Resistance (in Ohms, Ω)
- **ρ (rho)** = Resistivity of the material (in Ω⋅m)
- **L** = Length of the object (in meters, m)
- **A** = Cross-sectional Area of the object (in square meters, m²)

## Resistor Values
---
Colors represent different values depending on if the band is a digit, multiplier, or tolerance.
