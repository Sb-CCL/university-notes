# 1.17 Series and Parallel Combinations

## Definition
**Series circuits** have components connected end-to-end in a single path, while **parallel circuits** have components connected across common points, creating multiple paths for current flow.

## Series Circuits

### Characteristics
- **Same current** flows through all components: IÅ = IÇ = IÉ = Itotal
- **Voltages add up** across components: Vtotal = VÅ + VÇ + VÉ
- **Total resistance** is sum of individual resistances: Rtotal = RÅ + RÇ + RÉ

### Series Resistance Formula
```
Rtotal = RÅ + RÇ + RÉ + ... + Rn
```

## Parallel Circuits

### Characteristics
- **Same voltage** across all components: VÅ = VÇ = VÉ = Vtotal
- **Currents add up**: Itotal = IÅ + IÇ + IÉ
- **Total resistance** is less than the smallest individual resistance

### Parallel Resistance Formula
```
1/Rtotal = 1/RÅ + 1/RÇ + 1/RÉ + ... + 1/Rn
```

## Special Cases

### Two Resistors in Parallel
```
Rtotal = (RÅ ◊ RÇ)/(RÅ + RÇ)
```

## MATLAB Implementation
```matlab
function [R_series, R_parallel] = resistor_combinations(resistors)
% Calculate series and parallel combinations of resistors
R_series = sum(resistors);
R_parallel = 1 / sum(1 ./ resistors);
end
```
