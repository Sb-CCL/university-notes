# 1.18 Voltage Divider

## Definition
A **voltage divider** is a simple series circuit that produces an output voltage that is a fraction of the input voltage. It's one of the most fundamental and useful circuits in electronics.

## Basic Circuit
```
Vin ----[R1]----+----[R2]----GND
                 |
                Vout
```

## Voltage Divider Formula
The output voltage is given by:
```
Vout = Vin � (R2/(R1 + R2))
```

Where:
- **Vin** = Input voltage
- **Vout** = Output voltage
- **R1** = Upper resistor
- **R2** = Lower resistor (to ground)

## Key Principles

### Voltage Division
- Voltage divides **proportionally** to resistance values
- Larger resistance gets larger voltage drop
- Total voltage drops equal input voltage: VR1 + VR2 = Vin

### Current Flow
- Same current flows through both resistors: I = Vin/(R1 + R2)
- VR1 = I � R1 = Vin � (R1/(R1 + R2))
- VR2 = I � R2 = Vin � (R2/(R1 + R2))

## Design Considerations

### Loading Effects
- Output impedance = R1 || R2 = (R1 � R2)/(R1 + R2)
- Loading occurs when output current is significant
- Rule of thumb: Load resistance should be e 10� output impedance

### Power Consumption
- Continuous current flow = power consumption
- Power = Vin�/(R1 + R2)
- Trade-off: Lower resistance = less loading, more power consumption

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Basic Voltage Divider
- Given: Vin = 12V, R1 = 1k�, R2 = 3k�
- Find: Vout

**Solution:**
- Vout = 12V � (3k�/(1k� + 3k�)) = 12V � (3/4) = 9V

### Example 2: Design for Specific Output
- Given: Vin = 5V, want Vout = 3.3V, R2 = 10k�
- Find: R1

**Solution:**
- 3.3 = 5 � (10k/(R1 + 10k))
- 3.3(R1 + 10k) = 5 � 10k
- 3.3R1 + 33k = 50k
- R1 = (50k - 33k)/3.3 = 5.15k�

## Applications

### Reference Voltages
- Creating specific voltage levels for circuits
- Biasing transistors and op-amps
- Setting thresholds for comparators

### Sensor Interfaces
- **Potentiometers** - variable voltage dividers
- **Photoresistors** - light-sensitive voltage dividers
- **Thermistors** - temperature-sensitive voltage dividers

### Level Shifting
- Converting between different voltage levels
- Interfacing 5V and 3.3V systems
- Creating intermediate voltage references

## MATLAB Implementation
```matlab
function [Vout, I_total, P_total] = voltage_divider(Vin, R1, R2)
% Calculate voltage divider output, current, and power
% Inputs: Vin (input voltage), R1 (upper resistor), R2 (lower resistor)

Vout = Vin * (R2 / (R1 + R2));
I_total = Vin / (R1 + R2);
P_total = Vin^2 / (R1 + R2);

fprintf('Output voltage: %.2f V\n', Vout);
fprintf('Total current: %.2f mA\n', I_total * 1000);
fprintf('Total power: %.2f mW\n', P_total * 1000);
end
```

## Advanced Topics

### Thevenin Equivalent
- Thevenin voltage: Vth = Vin � (R2/(R1 + R2))
- Thevenin resistance: Rth = (R1 � R2)/(R1 + R2)

### AC Analysis
- Works with AC signals using impedance instead of resistance
- Frequency response considerations with capacitive/inductive elements

## Common Mistakes
1. **Ignoring loading effects** - connecting low-impedance loads
2. **Wrong resistor positions** - confusing R1 and R2 in formula
3. **Power ratings** - exceeding resistor power capabilities
4. **Precision assumptions** - not accounting for resistor tolerances

## Practice Problems
1. Design a voltage divider to get 2.5V from 5V using a 10k� resistor
2. A 9V battery with 4.7k� and 2.2k� resistors. Find Vout across 2.2k�
3. What's the output impedance of the divider in problem 2?

**Answers**: 1) Use 10k� for both R1 and R2, 2) 2.87V, 3) 1.51k�

## Summary
Voltage dividers are essential circuits for creating reference voltages and interfacing between different voltage levels. Understanding their behavior under load is crucial for proper circuit design.
