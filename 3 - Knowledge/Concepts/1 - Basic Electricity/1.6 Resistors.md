A resistor is an electrical component that obstructs or _resists_ current between the resistor's two terminals. The resistor property that obstructs current is called resistance. As resistance increases, more effort is required to produce a fixed current. 

Resistance is measured in units of ohms (abbreviated with the capital Greek letter omega, Ω). A particular resistor component's resistance is called the resistor's _value_. Producing a 1 A current through a 2 ohm resistance requires twice as much electrical effort as producing a 1 A current through a 1 ohm resistance. 

An ohmmeter is an instrument that measures resistance. A multimeter can also measure resistance, in addition to measuring current and voltage.

### Resistor materials

A resistor can be made out of any material. The intrinsic property of a material to resist current is called resistivity. Resistivity is measured in units of ohm-meters (Ω·m) and is represented by the Greek letter ρ (rho).

- A conductor is an object or material that has low resistivity. For example, metals, such as copper, gold, and aluminum, have ρ ≈ 10-8 Ω·m.
- An insulator is an object or material that has very high resistivity. For insulators, such as glass, dry wood, or air, ρ ≈ 1010-1016 Ω·m. Some plastics such as Teflon have resistivities as high as 1024 Ω·m.
- A superconductor has a resistivity of 0. Superconductors also have unique magnetic properties that are useful for medical imaging and scientific instruments.
- A semiconductor has a resistivity between that of a metal and an insulator. Silicon is a semiconductor commonly used in devices such as computers and mobile phones.

Most resistors are made of carbon or long narrow threads of metal wire wrapped around an insulating rod. The resistor material, shape, and dimensions determine the resistance.
