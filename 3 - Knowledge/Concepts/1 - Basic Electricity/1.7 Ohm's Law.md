# 1.7 Ohm's Law

## Definition
**Ohm's Law** states that the voltage across a resistor is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, with the resistance as the proportionality constant.

## The Formula
```
V = I × R
```
Where:
- **V** = Voltage (volts, V)
- **I** = Current (amperes, A)
- **R** = Resistance (ohms, ©)

## Alternative Forms
- **Current**: I = V/R
- **Resistance**: R = V/I
- **Power**: P = V × I = I²R = V²/R

## Key Concepts

### Linear Relationship
- If resistance is constant, voltage and current are directly proportional
- Double the voltage ’ double the current
- Triple the voltage ’ triple the current

### Practical Applications
1. **Circuit Analysis** - Calculate unknown values
2. **Component Selection** - Choose appropriate resistors
3. **Safety Calculations** - Determine safe operating limits
4. **Power Calculations** - Find energy consumption

## Example Problems

### Example 1: Find Current
- Given: V = 12V, R = 4©
- Find: I = ?
- Solution: I = V/R = 12V/4© = 3A

### Example 2: Find Resistance
- Given: V = 9V, I = 0.5A
- Find: R = ?
- Solution: R = V/I = 9V/0.5A = 18©

### Example 3: Find Voltage
- Given: I = 2A, R = 6©
- Find: V = ?
- Solution: V = I × R = 2A × 6© = 12V

## MATLAB Implementation
```matlab
function [voltage, current, resistance] = ohms_law(known1, known2, unknown)
% Calculate unknown electrical quantity using Ohm's Law
% Inputs: two known values and string for unknown ('V', 'I', or 'R')

switch unknown
    case 'V'
        voltage = known1 * known2;  % I * R
    case 'I'
        current = known1 / known2;  % V / R
    case 'R'
        resistance = known1 / known2; % V / I
end
```

## Important Notes
- Only applies to **ohmic materials** (linear V-I relationship)
- Temperature can affect resistance values
- Some materials (like diodes) don't follow Ohm's Law
- Always check units in calculations
