### 2-Knowledge-Base/

Cross-course knowledge organization:

- **Concepts/**: Atomic knowledge units and fundamental principles
- **People/**: Professors, researchers, and important figures
- **Research/**: Research ideas, literature notes, and proposals
- **References/**: Permanent notes and foundational knowledge

### 3-University/

University life management:

## üéØ Learning Methodology

This system supports:

- **Active Recall**: Question-based learning in note templates
- **Spaced Repetition**: Regular review of connected concepts
- **Interleaved Practice**: Connecting concepts across disciplines
- **Concept Mapping**: Using backlinks to visualize knowledge networks

## üìä Tags System

Use these tags for organization:

- `#course/CODE-101` - Course-specific tags
- `#topic/subject` - Subject matter tags
- `#type/lecture` - Note type tags
- `#status/complete` - Progress tracking tags
- `#review/daily` - Spaced repetition tags
