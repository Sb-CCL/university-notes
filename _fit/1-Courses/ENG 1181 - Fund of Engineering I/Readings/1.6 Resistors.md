Resistor
- obstructs or resists current between the resistor's two terminals
- depicted using as a zigzag line

Resistance
- property that obstructs current
- measured in units of ohms (Ω)
- the more resistance, the more effort required to produce a current

How do you calculate resistance?
> Resistivity times the length divided by the cross-sectional area

>Producing a 1 A current through a 2 ohm resistance requires twice as much electrical effort as producing a 1 A current through a 1 ohm resistance

Ohmmeter measures resistance

Multi-meter measures resistance, current, and voltage

Resistivity is measured in units of ohm-meters (Ω·m) and is represented by the Greek letter ρ (rho)

A conductor = has low resistivity
>Metals, such as copper, gold, and aluminum, have ρ ≈ 10-8 Ω·m.

Insulator = has very high resistivity. 
>glass, dry wood, or air, ρ ≈ 1010-1016 Ω·m. Some plastics such as Teflon have resistivities as high as 1024 Ω·m.

Superconductor = has a resistivity of 0
> Useful for medical imaging and scientific instruments.

Semiconductor = has a resistivity between a metal and an insulator. 
>Silicon is a great semiconductor used for chips
